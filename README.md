Amazing wallpapers about xamarin and his differents aspect. 

## (UPDATE) :small_red_triangle_down::small_red_triangle_down::small_red_triangle_down::small_red_triangle_down:
This repository is no longer updated. It has moved to [here](https://luismts.com/blog/category/wallpapers/). 

## Why is it?
I was thinking of changing my wallpaper in my cellphone, so I decided to look for one of xamarin. I spent some really hard minutes looking for one without result. So I designed some instead. I re-designed some images that I found as wallpapers for our cellphones and I was just testing the others. 

So, let's enjoy it.
